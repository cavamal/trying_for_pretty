## Dataset

> Provide basic information about your dataset in this section. If you selected your own dataset, make sure you note the source of your data and summarize any data wrangling steps that you performed before you started your exploration.


## Summary of Findings

* There's a (to me) surprisingly high failure rate amongst Prosper loans in this dataset. A 30.8% failures rate seems high, and suggests backing a Prosper loan is risky. 


### Assumptions
* CreditRating and ProsperRatings are equivalent. This hasn't been verified yet, but can be by comparing the Credit Scores against both of these to see a Prosper Rating and Credit Rating encompass the same bins. Not completing this exercise due to current time constraints.
